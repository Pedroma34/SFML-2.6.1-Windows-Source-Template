# SFML-2.6.1-Windows-Source-Template
 Generate Visual Studio 2022 project and Make files for SFML 2.6.1. I use this template so I can attach my personal project to this workspace and debug SFML from source. I've added an App project which links to SFML. You can see for yourself and debug it to see how SFML works.

 # How to build (Visual Studio 2022)
 Simply execute batch file to generate a VS2022 project. 
 # How to build (MinGW) (NEEDS WORK!)
 You can also generate Make files if you don't want to use VS2022. Execute "GenerateMakeFile," then it will produce the main makefile inside the Scripts folder. Run the command "make" and it will build the project for you.
